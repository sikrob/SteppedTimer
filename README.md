SteppedTimer is an iOS app for running a single timer that has multiple steps prior to completion.

(It currently does not support background operation.)

# LICENSE INFORMATION

SteppedTimer currently does NOT provide a license and all rights are retained by Robert Sikorski; no contributions will be accepted to prevent diluting original copyright. No recreation or use of this code is permitted.

I'm looking forward to changing this very soon, just focused on other things right now. If you see this note in the README.md, consider this project still fully copyrighted!

(This claim does NOT extend to material which can not be copyrighted by me, such as code used from Apple generally to create the app or any third party libraries.)
